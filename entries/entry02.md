I am currently in stages 3 and 4 of the **Engineering Design Process (EDP)** which is to *brainstorm possible solutions* and *plan the most promising solution*. These steps are not really related to what I am doing which is learning the tool. However, learning my tool will definitely help me brainstorm possible solutions and plan the most promising solution.
