# Entry 2
##### 12/1/22

After writing the [1st entry](entry01.md), learning the tool is the next step.
For the first few weeks, I played more on the [kaboom js playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?demo=add) which is a sandbox where you can tinker with the tool. Afterwards, I searched up on Google for [kaboom js](https://kaboomjs.com/) tutorials and I found a [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OaHB0JbJDI) that helped me learn more about the tool.

I created a kaboom template (it is the first one that pops up) on [replit](https://replit.com/~) (this was part of the tutorial). On the left side of the page where it says `Kaboom`, I looked down to see `Learn` and I learned my tool from there.

Some of the concepts I learned:
* game object - a character in the game
* `add()` - a function that adds all of the components you want in a character
* `area()` - gives a character an area like how we give a rectangle an area of 50 in.
* `body()` - gives the object physical world characteristics
* `onKeyPress()` - runs code when a certain key is played
* `pos()` - object's position on the display


I am currently in stages 3 and 4 of the **Engineering Design Process (EDP)** which is to *brainstorm possible solutions* and *plan the most promising solution*. These steps are not really related to what I am doing which is learning the tool. However, learning my tool will definitely help me brainstorm possible solutions and plan the most promising solution. The next step in the **EDP** is to *create a prototype* meaning I am going to build my game which is going to happen in a later time.

I am improving on the skills of *how to learn* and *time management*. Since right now I am learning my tool, I am going have to learn by myself. I have to search tutorials and documentations that will help me understand the game engine. Learning on your own (LOYO) takes time and I need to learn my tool somehow. It made me want to manage my time more efficiently. I started to learn my tool when I have free time.

My goal for the winter break is to find more tutorials to learn and build a miniproject along the way. Every day, I am going to dedicate myself of at least 1 hour and a half to learn and build. To make myself accountable, I will set up a calendar that will alarm me to the do the work. I will use the stopwatch instead of a timer to keep track of the time because I tend to keep looking at the phone when I use the timer.
