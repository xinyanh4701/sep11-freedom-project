# Entry 1
##### 11/8/22
The tool I decided to learn for the rest of the school year is [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/), a game engine. I originally chose [melonJS](https://melonjs.org/) as my tool for the Freedom Project. However, I couldn't download any files to tinker with melonJS. Another reason that I switched to Kaboom was that melonJS didn't have enough tutorials for me to learn more easily. 

I am currently in stages 1 and 2 of the **Engineering Design Process** which is to define  and research the problem. Although these steps are not really relevant to what I am going to make, I think stages 1 and 2 of the EDP are to choose my tool and tinker with the tool. For the next steps which is to brainstorm possible solutions, I should create code using my tool to do specific tasks that are going to be in my game.
