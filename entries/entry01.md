# Entry 1
##### 11/8/22
The tool I decided to learn for the rest of the school year is [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/), a game engine. I originally chose [melonJS](https://melonjs.org/) as my tool for the Freedom Project. One reason I choose Kaboom was I couldn't download any files to tinker with melonJS. Another reason that I switched to Kaboom was that melonJS didn't have enough tutorials (unlike Kaboom which had way more [tutorials](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro)) for me to learn more easily. Lastly, I couldn't find any online melonJS editors so I can tinker with the tool without having to download files. In Kaboom, the website had a [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?demo=add) where I can change the values and see what does this `function` or `if` statement do.

With Kaboom, I am going to a make an adventure action game that involves characters fighting each other. For the past few days, I had the idea to make a food type of game where you cook food in a fun way. Right now, I am sticking to the adventure action game.

I am currently in stages 1 and 2 of the **Engineering Design Process** which is to define  and research the problem. Although these steps are not really relevant to what I am going to make, I think stages 1 and 2 of the EDP are to choose my tool and tinker with the tool. For the next steps which is to brainstorm possible solutions, I should create code using my tool to do specific tasks that are going to be in my game.

This is helping me learn more about the skills of *How to read* and *How to Google*. When tinkering with your tool, you read more documentations to get a better understanding of your tool that you are going to use for the rest of the school year. The skill, `How to read` teaches me to look at the documentations more carefully and help me understand what to read to get the information I need. The skill, `How to Google` teaches me to type in more specifically to get the result I am looking for.
