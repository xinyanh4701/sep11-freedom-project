# Entry 6
##### 6/4/23

After going beyond the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), the class and I started [in-class presentatoins](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sVBJ3XjajvAtYxAoPKWP9viC68ll9e1K-qTcksPnSFI/edit?usp=sharing). Since I have already experienced presenting my Freedom Project, I didn't feel as much anxiety as last time. I still felt nervous as usual when presenting in front of people staring at you. My takeaways for this in-class presentation are to practice presenting more and instill confidence in yourself. In-class presentations is just one of the two requirements we have to complete presenting our projects.

The other presentation was the EXPO where you give an elevator pitch to the judges about your product. My takeaways for the EXPO was to be more confident on your project and the more you present your project, the more you feel confortable.

I am currently in **stage 8** of the *Engineering Design Process (EDP)* which is to **communicate the results**. Stage 8 is the final stage of the EDP. I have already presented my product in the EXPO and the in-class presentation.

I have grown in the skill of *communication* and *growth mindset*.
