# Entry 3
##### 2/12/2023

Here are the concepts that I have learned:
**Components**
* circle()
* origin()
* opacity()
**Events**
* onHover()
* onMouseDown()
**Info**
* time()
* isKeyDown()

I am currently in stages 3 and 4 of the **Engineering Design Process (EDP)** which is to *brainstorm possible solutions* and *plan the most promising solution*. Right now, I am still learning my tool. Although these steps of the EDP are not directly related to the stages, learning my tool will help me brainstorm possible solutions and plan the most promising solutions later. The next step of the **EDP** is to *create a prototype* where I am going to build my game in a later time.

I am improving on the skills of *how to learn* and *how to Google*. I am still learning my tool which I need to learn by myself. Learning what to type(Google) is essential to helping me learn the necessary information.

My goal for my learning is to try to learn all the necessary information I need to help me make my game.
