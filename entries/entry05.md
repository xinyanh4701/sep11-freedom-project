### Process of My MVP

After creating the intro of the game, I worked on the actual game scenes where the player can interact with the screen.

In the **Engineering Design Process (EDP)**, I am on stages 5 and 6 of the EDP which are to *create a prototype* and *test and evaluate the prototype*. Right now, I have created my MVP (Minimum Viable Product). I still need to fix some minor errors.

The skills I have picked up for this blog are **Embracing Failure** and **Debugging**. At this moment in time, I am creating an actual functional game. Creating a game is going to include bugs and errors which you can't avoid.
