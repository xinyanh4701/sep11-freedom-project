# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Xin Yan Huang

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about making any product to showcase what you have learned for the tool you used to help you build the project. The purpose of this blog is to show your progress of how you chose the JavaScript tool, how did you learn your tool effectively, the steps it took to make your actual project, your grows and glows, and the skills you acquired for this project.

## Content
For my project, I am making an interactive cake game using [Kaboom JS](https://kaboomjs.com/). This blog will walk through my process of independently studying [Kaboom JS](https://kaboomjs.com/) in order to make the cake game.
